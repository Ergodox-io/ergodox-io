                    <h1>The Keyboard</h1>
                

            <p>The Ergodox is a do-it-yourself keyboard project designed with ergonomics in mind. It uses 76-80 Cherry MX style mechanical switches (such as Cherry or Gateron) laid out in a columnar stagger (rather than the more conventional row stagger) layout with components that can easily be sourced. It’s completely programmable and can be flashed with several different firmware options.</p>

<p>The entire project (including this website) are Open Source, allowing you the freedom to modify and tweak the project as you see fit.</p>

<p>Assembling this project will require some patience, soldering ability, and access to a computer to flash the firmware onto the keyboard.</p>

                    <h2>Who built this?</h2>
                

            <p>The ErgoDox keyboard is a DIY keyboard project originally developed by “Dox” (Dominic Beauchamp) inspired by the <a href="https://www.key64.org">Key64 Keyboard</a>.</p>

<p>The printed circuit board was designed by “bpiphany” (Fredrik Atmer).</p>

<p>The original 3D printable case was designed by Dox but a far more popular and less expensive option was a layered acrylic design by litster.</p>

<p>This website was built by robotmaxtron with some help from the community as a way to centralize the documentation after ErgoDox.org went defunct.
If you want to contribute to the project, pull requests, bugs (via Github issues) can be filed at our <a href="https://github.com/Ergodox-io/ergodox-io">Github</a></p>

<p>Both the keyboard design and hardware files are licensed under the GNU Public License 3</p>

                    <h1>Guide</h1>
                

            <p>A few things will need to be decided in advance before choosing parts or cases. The ErgoDox supports either the standard 76 key or 80 key layout.</p>

<p>This project will require some tools such as a soldering iron, flush cutters, wire strippers, solder, and possibly a screwdriver.</p>

<p>The build guide also assumes that you already know how to solder, if you do not know how to solder or want a refresher there are several guides available on YouTube and other places on the internet.</p>

                    <h2>Parts Needed</h2>
                

            <p>To build an Ergodox, several readily available components will need to be procured.</p>

<p>Some notes on the electronics:</p>

<p>The Cherry MX style switches can be either pcb or plate mounted.</p>

<p>Either through hole or surface mount diodes can be used as the pcb supports both including in-switch through hole diodes.</p>

<p>If the typical 3mm red leds are not used, be sure to replace the 220 Ω resistors with ones that match the leds chosen.</p>

<p>PJRC sells a Teensy 2.0 both with and without header pins pre-installed. If you use a Teensy without the header pins pre-installed, you will need to obtain and install them.</p>

<p>The pcb only supports presently, three in switch LEDs on the inner colum of the right hand labeled LEDa, LEDb, and LEDc.</p>

<p>Many if not all of the small components can be easily found online at vendors such as Mouser or Digikey.</p>

                    <h4>Printed Circuit Boards</h4>
            

            <p>The pcb files are available in a separate repo available <a href="https://github.com/Ergodox-io/ErgoDox">here</a> should you wish to modify and/or produce them.</p>

<ul>
  <li>There are several vendors who generally stock some of the older revisions of the pcbs.

  <li>You could also buy the updated pcb from your vendor of choice by providing them the KiCad or Gerber files in the repo listed above or purchase a batch from OSH Park

                    <h4>Case & Keycaps</h4>
            

            <p>While there are many options of materials available (such as cases carved out of wood) generally ErgoDox cases are either 3D printed or layered acrylic sheets.</p>

<p>The 3D printable case options are available in our <a href="https://github.com/Ergodox-io/ergodox-case">repo</a> and have been uploaded to <a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/Dox">Shapeways</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>The most popular and less expensive option is the layered acrylic design.
<a href="https://github.com/Ergodox-io/ErgoDox/tree/master/ErgoDox%20Acrylic%20Case">Github Repo</a> assembled with m3 bolts.
    <ul>
      <li>There is also a 3D printable <a href="https://github.com/Ergodox-io/ergodox-tent">tenting stand</a> in our repo. This will prop up the ErgoDox at a very natural and comfortable angle.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Like any mechanical keyboard, keycaps will need to be obtained. In a normal 76 key configuration you will need:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>  12x    1.5u
  4x      2u
  60x    1u
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If the 80 key layout is used, a slightly different keycap configuration will be needed replacing the 2u keys with two 1u keys each:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>  12x     1.5u 
  68x    1u 
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The 1.5u outer column keys can optionally be mounted closer in and 1u keycaps can be used.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Note: This layout is only supported on the newer (post 2012) revisions of the pcb and will require a modified plate design to support the new placement.
</code></pre>

      <li>1b. If <em>through hole</em> diodes are chosen, place them through the two hole immediately to the left and right of copper pads under the square that the switch will take up.

            <p>There are a number of options for the firmware powering the ErgoDox keyboard, each with their own sets of features and options. Please consult the README guides for each firmware for specific instructions on how to use and compile it.</p>

            <p>A build guide for compiling and customizing your firmware is best found in the repo’s <a href="https://github.com/jackhumbert/qmk_firmware">readme</a></p>

<p>Note: There are many users who have committed their keymaps that can be built on and easily adapted to suit your needs.</p>

<p>The QMK Online Configuration tool listed in the ErgoDox-EZ can also be used to generate .hex files for this original design and is based on QMK.</p>

            <p>Massdrop has developed an online tool for generating Ergodox keymaps without the need to compile your own firmware, suggested for users who might not be comfortable compiling their own firmware.</p>

            <p>The originally designed firmware is also available, though fallen out of favor due to QMK and TMK’s improved functionalty and larger community support. The project has not had much movement since late 2015.</p>

                    <h3>Flashing your Ergodox</h3>
                

            <p>Once the firmware has been compiled down into a .hex file, it will need to be uploaded to the keyboard typically called flashing.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flashing your Ergodox is typically done with the <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/loader.html">Teensy Loader</a>, and will be needed for the following guide.
    <ol>
      <li>Locate your .hex file generated by your firmware of choice</li>
      <li>Start the Teensy Loader program</li>
      <li>Load the .hex file into it.</li>
      <li>Press the Reset button by pressing the reset button onboard the Teensy, you may need to insert something such as a paperclip or small screwdriver gently into the reset hole in the top right corner of your case.

            <p>The Ergodox by nature as an open source project has been forked and changed since it’s initial design, the following projects are just a selection of the more popular ones.</p>

            <p>Quickly becoming the most popular variant of the ErgoDox and developed by Input.club, the Ergodox Infinity has an LCD screen built into each half with a few other updates to the original design.</p>
