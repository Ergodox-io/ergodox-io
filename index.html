                    <h1>The Keyboard</h1>
                

            <p>Ergodox is a keyboard project designed with ergonomics in mind, available either as a DIY kit or an <a href="http://ergodox-ez.com">assembled, commercial version</a>. It uses 76-80 Cherry MX style mechanical switches (such as Cherry or Gateron) laid out in a columnar stagger (rather than the more conventional row stagger) layout with components that can easily be sourced. The keyboard is completely programmable and can be flashed with several different firmware options.</p>

<p>The entire project (including this website) is open source, allowing you the freedom to modify and tweak the project as you see fit.</p>

<p>Assembling this project will require some patience, soldering ability, and access to a computer to flash the firmware onto the keyboard.</p>

                    <h2>Who built this?</h2>
                

            <p>The ErgoDox keyboard is a DIY keyboard project originally developed by “Dox” (Dominic Beauchamp) inspired by the <a href="https://www.key64.org">Key64 Keyboard</a>.</p>

<p>The printed circuit board was designed by “bpiphany” (Fredrik Atmer).</p>

<p>The original 3D printable case was designed by Dox but a far more popular and less expensive option was a layered acrylic design by litster.</p>

<p>The original firmware was designed by Ben Blazak.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://ergodox-ez.com">ErgoDox EZ</a> was commercialized and manufactured by Erez Zukerman, Dmitry Slepov, and Yaara Lancet.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jackhumbert/qmk_firmware">QMK Firmware</a> which runs on the ErgoDox EZ was created by Jack Humbert, based on TMK.</p>

<p>This website was built by robotmaxtron with some help from the community as a way to centralize the documentation after ErgoDox.org went defunct.
If you want to contribute to the project, pull requests, bugs (via Github issues) can be filed at our <a href="https://github.com/Ergodox-io/ergodox-io">Github</a></p>

<p>Both the keyboard design and hardware files are licensed under the GNU Public License 3</p>

                    <h1>Guide</h1>
                

            <p>A few things will need to be decided in advance before choosing parts or cases. The ErgoDox supports either the standard 76 key or 80 key layout.</p>

<p>This project will require some tools such as a soldering iron, flush cutters, wire strippers, solder, and possibly a screwdriver.</p>

<p>The build guide also assumes that you already know how to solder, if you do not know how to solder or want a refresher there are several guides available on YouTube and other places on the internet.</p>

                    <h2>Parts Needed</h2>
                

            <p>To build an ErgoDox, some readily available components will need to be procured.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Some notes on the electronics before purchasing:
    <ul>
      <li>The Cherry MX style switches can be either pcb or plate mounted.</li>
      <li>Either through hole or surface mount diodes can be used as the pcb supports both including in-switch through hole diodes.</li>
      <li>If the typical 3mm red leds are not used, be sure to replace the 220 Ω resistors with ones that match the leds chosen.</li>
      <li>PJRC sells a Teensy 2.0 both with and without header pins pre-installed. If you use a Teensy without the header pins pre-installed, you will need to obtain and install them.</li>
      <li>The pcb only supports currently three in switch LEDs on the inner colum of the right hand labeled LEDa, LEDb, and LEDc.</li>
      <li>Many if not all of the small components can be easily found online at vendors such as Mouser or Digikey.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


        </section>
    

    
        <section id="pcbs" class="h4">
            
                    <h4>Printed Circuit Boards</h4>
            

            <p>The pcb files are available in a separate repo available <a href="https://github.com/Ergodox-io/ErgoDox">here</a> should you wish to modify and/or produce them.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The latest revision of the pcbs can be purchased from the following vendors
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://shop.profetkeyboards.com/product/ergodox-pcbs">ProfetKeyboards.com</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Several vendors are available who generally stock some of the older revisions of the pcbs.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&amp;p=537">MechanicalKeyboards.com</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://falbatech.pl/prestashop/index.php?id_product=10&amp;controller=product&amp;id_lang=2">Falbatech.pl</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You could also buy the updated pcb from a vendor of choice by providing them the KiCad or Gerber files in the repo listed above or purchase a batch from OSH Park</p>

<p>Keep an eye out on the ErgoDox repo <a href="https://github.com/Ergodox-io/ErgoDox/releases">revision</a> changelogs for updates and differences between pcb versions.</p>

                    <h4>Case & Keycaps</h4>
            

            <p>While there are many options of materials available (such as cases carved out of wood) generally ErgoDox cases are either 3D printed or layered acrylic sheets.</p>

<p>The 3D printable case options are available in our <a href="https://github.com/Ergodox-io/ergodox-case">repo</a> and have been uploaded to <a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/Dox">Shapeways</a></p>

<p>The most popular and less expensive option is the layered acrylic design.
<a href="https://github.com/Ergodox-io/ErgoDox/tree/master/ErgoDox%20Acrylic%20Case">Github Repo</a> assembled with m3 bolts.</p>

<p>There is also a 3D printable <a href="https://github.com/Ergodox-io/ergodox-tent">tenting stand</a> in the repo organization. This will prop up the ErgoDox using Litster’s case at a very natural and comfortable angle.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Like any mechanical keyboard, keycaps will need to be obtained. In a normal 76 key configuration the following keycaps will be needed:
    <ul>
      <li>12x 1.5u</li>
      <li>4x  2u</li>
      <li>60x 1u</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The 1.5u outer column keys can optionally be mounted closer in and 1u keycaps can be used.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Note: This layout is only supported on the newer (post 2012) revisions of the pcb and will require a modified plate design to support the new placement.
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>If the 80 key layout is used, a slightly different keycap configuration will be needed replacing the 2u keys with two 1u keys each:
    <ul>

            <p>Now the section where the soldering and real assembly happens, in the next subsection there will be a couple external links to other build guides including both a photo and video build log.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Arrange the pcbs face down and solder in the diodes to this side.
    <ul>
      <li>1a. If <em>surface mount</em> diodes are chosen, place them on the small square copper pads but be sure to orient the diodes so that the line on the diode faces the square hole. The line on the diode indicates the cathode/negative side. Solder the diodes and repeat for each switch on both hands.</li>
      <li><img src="../img/diode-min.jpg" alt="diode" /></li>
      <li>1b. If <em>through hole</em> diodes are chosen, place them through the two hole immediately to the left and right of copper pads under the square that the switch will take up. Be sure to check the orientation to be sure that the cathode/negative side of the diode is closest to the square hole. Solder and repeat for each switch on both hands.</li>
      <li><img src="../img/th-diode-min.jpg" alt="Through-hole diode" />
        <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> Note: The additional holes in this second image are for through switch LEDs. Only one diode per switch is needed.
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Flip both of the pcbs over, this face up side (without the diodes) will be the side that the remaining components will be placed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Insert both the 2.2k ohm resistors and 220 ohm (or whatever resistors chosen appropriate for the leds selected) onto the right hand where labled on the pcb and solder into place.
    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Note: Keep the legs clipped off the resistors, they can be used in a later step when the TRRS connections are installed.
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>On the left hand pcb, insert the I/O expander around the MCP23018 rectangle. The I/O expander is directional and the notch on the I/O expander should match up with the silkscreen. The notch on the expander will be facing ErgoDox printing on the circuit board. See the image in the next step for an example.
    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Note: There are three holes without copper pads and do not need to be soldered.
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li><em>(Optional but suggested step)</em> On the left hand pcb, insert the ceramic capacitor into the first and third holes of the top row and solder in place.
    <ul>
      <li>5a. Bridge with solder the two copper pads immediately to the left of the ceramic capacitor.</li>
      <li><img src="../img/ceramic-min.jpg" alt="capacitor" /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Insert either jumper wire or the legs clipped from the resistors bent into a U, into both of the the white pairs of holes on either side of where the 3.5mm connections will go and solder in place.
    <ul>
      <li>6a. Place 3.5mm connection, solder the 4 connection points.</li>
      <li>6b. Repeat both the jumper and 3.5mm connectors on the other hand.</li>
      <li><img src="../img/trrs-min.jpg" alt="trrs" /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Install the male jumper pins to the underside of the Teensy with the button face up and solder the pins to the top side of the Teensy.
    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Note: If the Teensy already has jumpers already installed, skip this step.
</code></pre></div>    </div>

  <li>Insert the Teensy jumper legs from the Teensy assembly onto the right hand pcb with the usb facing the direction of the resistors and solder in place.
    <ul>
      <li><img src="../img/teensy-min.jpg" alt="teensy" /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cut one of the mini usb cables about 1.5” from the connector.
    <ul>
      <li>9a. Strip off all of the sheathing from the cable, exposing the 4 wires.</li>
      <li>9b. Place the following wires into their respective holes:

    <ul>
      <li><img src="../img/usb-min.jpg" alt="usb" /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Prepare the chosen case.
    <ul>
      <li>11a. If the layered acrylic case design is being used, peel off the protective film off the acrylic pieces.
        <ul>
          <li>Place the pcb under the 3rd acrylic layer and insert the switches into the acylic plate making sure that both pins from the switch are extending out through the pcb.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>11b. If the 3D printed case is being used
        <ul>
          <li>Place the pcb under the top section and push the switches into the case making sure that both pins from the switch are extending out through the pcb.</li>

                    <h2>Gamepad</h2>
                

            <p>User Profet23 of <a href="http://profetkeyboards.com">profetkeyboards.com</a> has made some pcb updates that have been merged into the main pcb repo to allow for left hand only ErgoDox support. This is ideal as a gamepad or other single left-handed usage.</p>

<p><img src="../img/gamepad0-min.jpg" alt="Gamepad" /></p>

<p>An example of the a finished build</p>

<p><img src="../img/gamepad1-min.jpg" alt="Gamepad" /></p>

<p>The PCB has now has pads that support the installation of an optional reset switch. The Teensy 2.0 is actually installed upside down, the built in reset switch is not accessible. There is also an extra hole for the Teensy to solder a header pin for the reset switch.</p>

<p><img src="../img/gamepad2-min.jpg" alt="Gamepad" /></p>

<p>The new “top” of PCB. Teensy is installed upside down. 2.2k resistors, jumpers, and USB port installed on top. In this revision of the PCB, the jumpers dictate which side the USB port can be installed on as well as the TRRS port (which isn’t used in gamepad configuration).</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>	Note: that the USB connection wires are installed (from left to right) empty, black, green, red, white. This is different from the silk screen layout as the usb port is now on "backwards".
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><img src="../img/gamepad4-min.jpg" alt="Gamepad" /></p>

<p>The new “bottom” of the PCB. The reset switch has been soldered to the bottom. LED resistors have also been soldered to bottom.</p>
