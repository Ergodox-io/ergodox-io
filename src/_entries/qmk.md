A build guide for compiling and customizing your firmware is best found in the repo's [readme](https://github.com/jackhumbert/qmk_firmware)

	Note: There are many users who have committed their keymaps that can be built on and easily adapted to suit your needs.

The ErgoDox-EZ Configurator tool can also be used to generate keymappings and their .hex files with QMK.
