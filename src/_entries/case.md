There are other options available but generally Ergodox cases are either 3D printed or layered, laser cut acrylic sheets.

The 3D printable case options are available in our [repo](https://github.com/Ergodox-io/ergodox-case) and have been uploaded to [Shapeways](http://www.shapeways.com/shops/Dox)

The most popular and less expensive option is the layered acrylic design.
