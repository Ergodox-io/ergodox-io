While there are many options of materials available (such as cases carved out of wood) generally ErgoDox cases are either 3D printed or layered acrylic sheets.

The 3D printable case options are available in our [repo](https://github.com/Ergodox-io/ergodox-case) and have been uploaded to [Shapeways](http://www.shapeways.com/shops/Dox)

The most popular and less expensive option is the layered acrylic design.
[Github Repo](https://github.com/Ergodox-io/ErgoDox/tree/master/ErgoDox%20Acrylic%20Case) assembled with m3 bolts.

There is also a 3D printable [tenting stand](https://github.com/Ergodox-io/ergodox-tent) in the repo organization. This will prop up the ErgoDox using Litster's case at a very natural and comfortable angle.


- Like any mechanical keyboard, keycaps will need to be obtained. In a normal 76 key configuration the following keycaps will be needed:
  - 12x 1.5u
  - 4x  2u
  - 60x 1u

The 1.5u outer column keys can optionally be mounted closer in and 1u keycaps can be used. 

	Note: This layout is only supported on the newer (post 2012) revisions of the pcb and will require a modified plate design to support the new placement.

- If the 80 key layout is used, a slightly different keycap configuration will be needed replacing the 2u keys with two 1u keys each:
  - 12x 1.5u 
  - 68x 1u
