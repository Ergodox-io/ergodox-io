The pcb files are available in a separate repo available [here](https://github.com/Ergodox-io/ErgoDox) should you wish to modify and/or produce them.

There are several vendors who generally stock some of the older revisions of the pcbs.

* [MechanicalKeyboards.com](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=537)

* [Falbatech.pl](http://falbatech.pl/prestashop/index.php?id_product=10&controller=product&id_lang=2)

You could also buy the updated pcb from your vendor of choice by providing them the KiCad or Gerber files in the repo listed above or purchase a batch from OSH Park
