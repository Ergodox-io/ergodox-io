Another fork of the ErgoDox is a pre-built version with a case that supports legs that will allow you to 'tent' or angle the ErgoDox-EZ.

- Firmware:
  - [QMK](http://qmk.fm/)
  - [ErgoDox EZ Online Configurator](http://configure.ergodox-ez.com/keyboard_layouts/new) for graphically configuring layouts (no coding required)
  - [TMK](https://github.com/ErgoDox-EZ/reactor/blob/master/lib/firmware/TMK_README.md)

- Differences between the original ErgoDox and the ErgoDox-EZ:
  - Preassembled
  - Custom-tooled case made from ABS plastic
  - Two-year warranty
  - Custom-built tilt/tent kit with metal legs that allow you to control the angle of the keyboard on your desk
  - Custom-made wrist rest (wing) available
  - Available with RGB LED case underglow 
  - As of January 2018, the ErgoDox-EZ now ships with hot swappable switches called CIY (Change It Yourself).
