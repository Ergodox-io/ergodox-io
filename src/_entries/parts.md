To build an Ergodox, several readily available components will need to be procured.

Some notes on the electronics:

The Cherry MX style switches can be either pcb or plate mounted.

Either through hole or surface mount diodes can be used as the pcb supports both including in-switch through hole diodes.

If the typical 3mm red leds are not used, be sure to replace the 220 Î© resistors with ones that match the leds chosen.

PJRC sells a Teensy 2.0 both with and without header pins pre-installed. If you use a Teensy without the header pins pre-installed, you will need to obtain and install them.

The pcb only supports presently, three in switch LEDs on the inner colum of the right hand labeled LEDa, LEDb, and LEDc.

Many if not all of the small components can be easily found online at vendors such as Mouser or Digikey.
