A few things will need to be decided in advance before choosing parts or cases. The ErgoDox supports either the standard 76 key or 80 key layout.

This project will require some tools such as a soldering iron, flush cutters, wire strippers, solder, and possibly a screwdriver.

The build guide also assumes that you already know how to solder, if you do not know how to solder or want a refresher there are several guides available on YouTube and other places on the internet.
