The ErgoDox keyboard is a DIY keyboard project originally developed by "Dox" (Dominic Beauchamp) inspired by the [Key64 Keyboard](https://www.key64.org).

The printed circuit board was designed by "bpiphany" (Fredrik Atmer).

The original 3D printable case was designed by Dox but a far more popular and less expensive option was a layered acrylic design by litster.

This website was built by robotmaxtron with some help from the community as a way to centralize the documentation after ErgoDox.org went defunct.
If you want to contribute to the project, pull requests, bugs (via Github issues) can be filed at our [Github](https://github.com/Ergodox-io/ergodox-io)
