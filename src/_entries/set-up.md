Setting Docster up is super simple. Just like with all jekyll-sites you just need a GitHub account to host it. Docster is independent of any plugins so the only requirement is a jekyll installation to check the result before pushing.

So download this theme, navigate into the folder, open a terminal and type

{% highlight bash %}
jekyll serve
{% endhighlight %}

You will then be able to see the page at **localhost:4000** and make your changes. When you are happy just push them to github in a gh-pages branch and you're site will be compiled by GitHub for you.
