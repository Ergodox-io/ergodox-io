Ergodox is a keyboard project designed with ergonomics in mind, available either as a DIY kit or an [assembled, commercial version](http://ergodox-ez.com). It uses 76-80 Cherry MX style mechanical switches (such as Cherry or Gateron) laid out in a columnar stagger (rather than the more conventional row stagger) layout with components that can easily be sourced. The keyboard is completely programmable and can be flashed with several different firmware options.

The entire project (including this website) is open source, allowing you the freedom to modify and tweak the project as you see fit.

Assembling this project will require some patience, soldering ability, and access to a computer to flash the firmware onto the keyboard.
