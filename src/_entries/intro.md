The website is a community built and sponsered project as is the Ergodox keyboard.

If you want to contribute to the website, pull requests, bugs (via Github issues) can be filed at our [Github](https://github.com/Ergodox-io/ergodox-io)

The ErgoDox keyboard is a DIY keyboard project kit originally developed by "Dox" (Dominic Beauchamp).
The printed circuit board was designed by "bpiphany" (Fredrik Atmer).
The original 3D printable case was designed by Dox but a far more popular and less expensive option was a layered acrylic design by litster.
