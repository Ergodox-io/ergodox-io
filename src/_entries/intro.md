The ErgoDox keyboard is a DIY keyboard project kit originally developed by "Dox" (Dominic Beauchamp).
The printed circuit board was designed by "bpiphany" (Fredrik Atmer).
The original 3D printable case was designed by Dox but a far more popular and less expensive option was a layered acrylic design by litster.
