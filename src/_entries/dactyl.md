Created by Matthew Adereth, the Dactyl Keyboard is a parameterized, split-hand, concave, columnar, ergonomic keyboard is another outstanding variation on the ErgoDox design.

[Build Guide](https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard/blob/master/guide/README.org#wiring) for the brave (will be improved over time)

The case is uploaded to the [things directory](https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard/blob/master/things) of the Dactyl repo and has been uploaded to [Shapeways](https://www.shapeways.com/shops/bespokeys)

[Clojure/conj Talk on 3D Printing Keyboards](http://adereth.github.io/blog/2015/11/19/clojure-slash-conj-talk-on-3d-printing-keyboards/): Adereth gave a very interesting talk on the history of keyboards and the creation of the very interesting shape of the Dactyl Keyboard.

- Differences between the ErgoDox and the Dactyl:
  - 70 key layout, removes the inner column of keys.
  - 1u outer column keys rather than the standard 1.5u
  - Handwired or flexible pcb
  - Concave shaped switch mounting
  - No official firmware but several options available.
