is-parent: yes

The Ergodox is a do it yourself keyboard project designed with ergonomics in mind. It uses 76-80 mechanical switches (such as Cherry or Gateron) with components that can easily be sourced. It's completely programmable and can be flashed with several different firmware options.

The entire project (including this website) are Open Source, allowing you the freedom to modify and tweak the project as you see fit.

Assembling this project will require some patience, soldering ability, and access to a computer to flash the firmware onto the keyboard.
