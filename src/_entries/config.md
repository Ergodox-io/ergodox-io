There is very few configuration to be done before you are up and running, still the ones you need to add, are as follows:

In the `_config.yml`-file:

{% highlight yaml %}
# name of the docs
name: Docster Documentation

# docs author
author: DigitalMind

# docs version
version: V 1.0
{% endhighlight %}

All of these infos will be displayed on the top left-hand corner.

Of course you can also go in and change the sass-output-format or change whatever else you want to adjust.
