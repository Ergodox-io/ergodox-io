Differences between the original ErgoDox and the Infinity:
- In-switch backlighting
- USB-C replaces TRRS between the two halves
- Each half can be used independently
- Pre-soldered smd components, only switches and LEDs will need to be soldered
- LCD screens on each keyboard half
- Proper costar stabilizer support
- ALPS switch support
