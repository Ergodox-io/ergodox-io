# ergodox.io
The new home of the Ergodox project; an entirely open source, split hand, keyboard designed with ergonomics in mind.

Site is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and themed with [Docster](http://digitalmindch.github.io/docster-jekyll-theme/)

##Repo Structure:
Github page is served to Ergodox.io from the deploy directory. Jekyll build at the root of the repo will put the rendered files into this deploy directory.

## Ready to push to the live site?
`git subtree push --prefix deploy origin gh-pages`
