# [ergodox.io](http://www.ergodox.io)
The new home of the ErgoDox project; an entirely open source, split hand, keyboard designed with ergonomics in mind.

Site is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and themed with [Docster](http://digitalmindch.github.io/docster-jekyll-theme/)

##Repo Structure:
Github page is served to ergodox.io from the deploy directory. `Jekyll build` in the /src directory will put the rendered files into this /deploy directory.

## Ready to push to the live site?
`git subtree push --prefix deploy origin gh-pages`
