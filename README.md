# ergodox.io
The new home of the Ergodox Project, an entirely open source, split, keyboard designed with ergonomics in mind.

Site is built with Jekyll (jekyllrb.com) and themed with Docster (http://digitalmindch.github.io/docster-jekyll-theme/)

Github page is served from the deploy directory where running a jekyll build will drop the files into

Once you're sure you're ready to push what's in deploy live, push with:
git subtree push --prefix deploy upstream gh-pages
